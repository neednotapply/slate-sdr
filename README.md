# slate-sdr

OpenWrt firmware that turns a **GL.iNet GL-AR750S(-EXT) "Slate"** into a
receiver station for an **RTL-SDR** and a **HackRF** on its USB port. It
decodes and logs to the **microSD card** by itself, and it shares both radios
over the network with SDR software on a computer.

Nothing in this firmware transmits. HackRF boards with a dead transmit path
work fine.

| Job | Radio | What | Live | On the card |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `soapy` | both | SoapySDR network server for SDR++, GQRX, CubicSDR, SDRangel, GNU Radio | `tcp://<router>:55132` | – |
| `rtltcp` | RTL-SDR | rtl_tcp server (SDR#, SDR++, GQRX) | `<router>:1234` | – |
| `adsb` | RTL-SDR | aircraft, 1090 MHz (dump1090) | map on `:8080`, SBS `:30003`, Beast `:30005` | aircraft table every minute |
| `ism` | RTL-SDR | sensors, remotes, meters on 433/868/915 MHz (rtl_433, 200+ protocols) | `:8433` | JSON lines |
| `ais` | RTL-SDR | ships, 162 MHz (rtl_ais) | NMEA on TCP `:10110` (OpenCPN) | NMEA |
| `survey` | HackRF | spectrum sweep 1 MHz – 6 GHz (hackrf_sweep) | – | CSV, hourly, gzipped |
| `rtlsurvey` | RTL-SDR | spectrum sweep 24 MHz – 1.7 GHz (rtl_power) | – | CSV, hourly, gzipped |
| `iq` | either | raw IQ recording, continuous, in segments | – | SigMF (`.sigmf-data` + `.sigmf-meta`) |
| `wifi` | built-in Wi-Fi | spectral scan of the 2.4 GHz (ath9k) and 5 GHz (ath10k) radios | – | raw FFT samples |

Out of the box, `soapy`, `adsb` (RTL-SDR) and `survey` (HackRF, one sweep a
minute) are on. Each radio runs one job at a time. Between survey sweeps the
HackRF is free for network clients.

## How this relates to w1700k-sdr

[w1700k-sdr](https://github.com/h0m3us3r/w1700k-sdr) gets raw IQ out of a
Wi-Fi 7 chip (the MT7996). That chip has an internal capture engine and
radio firmware that can be replaced, and the router has 10 GbE to carry
1.28 GB/s. The Slate's Qualcomm Atheros radios have neither feature, and a
775 MHz MIPS CPU with USB 2.0 and gigabit Ethernet could not carry that rate
anyway. What these radios do have is hardware **spectral scan**: FFT power
readings rather than IQ. The `wifi` job uses it. Real IQ comes from the USB
radios.

## What you need

- GL-AR750S or GL-AR750S-EXT. This firmware is OpenWrt's `NOR/NAND` variant,
  which fits the layout of GL.iNet's firmware 3.x and later.
- RTL-SDR and/or HackRF. The router has **one USB port**, so for both
  radios use a **powered USB hub**: the HackRF draws about 500 mA by itself.
- microSD card, **formatted exFAT and named `SLATESDR`** (format it on any
  computer). FAT32 and ext4 also work. Without the card, jobs keep serving
  the network and write nothing to the router's flash.
- Antennas suited to what you want to receive: 1090 MHz for ADS-B, 433 or
  868/915 MHz for ISM, 162 MHz for AIS.

## Build

Two builds, from the same packages:

| | `./build.sh` | `./build-full.sh` |
|---|---|---|
| How | OpenWrt SDK + ImageBuilder in Docker | full OpenWrt source build |
| Time | ~10 min | ~40 min on GitHub's 4-core runners, ~20 GB disk |
| Kernel | OpenWrt 25.12.6 release kernel | rebuilt with `CONFIG_RELAY` |
| Wi-Fi spectral (`wifi` job) | no | yes |
| 5 GHz driver | ath10k-ct (OpenWrt default) | upstream ath10k + Qualcomm firmware |

```sh
./build.sh                     # needs Docker
ls out/firmware/*sysupgrade.bin

./build-full.sh --config-only  # check the configuration (minutes)
./build-full.sh                # needs OpenWrt's build prerequisites, not as root
ls out/firmware-full/*sysupgrade.bin
```

**Lean by default.** The image carries only what the device uses, and includes
`zram-swap` (compressed RAM swap) to give the 128 MB box headroom under the
SDR + recon load. Optional extras live in `config/packages-extra.txt` and are
left out unless you ask for them — currently just the MQTT broker:

```sh
SLATE_EXTRAS=1 ./build.sh          # "complete" image: adds the MQTT broker
SLATE_EXTRAS=1 ./build-full.sh     # same, full source build
```

**On GitHub:** every push to `main` runs the *Build firmware* workflow,
which builds both images and uploads them as artifacts:
`slate-sdr-firmware` after about 5 minutes (with the tests), and
`slate-sdr-firmware-full` after about 40 minutes. Pull requests get the quick build
only, and a newer push cancels the builds of an older one. *Actions → Build
firmware → Run workflow* starts both by hand.

Which to flash: the quick image keeps OpenWrt's release kernel, so kernel
modules from OpenWrt's repository (`apk add kmod-…`) install on it. The full
image has its own kernel, so modules for it have to be added to the build.
Its 5 GHz radio also runs upstream ath10k instead of OpenWrt's default
ath10k-ct. The radios, decoders and logging are the same in both.

## Install

1. In GL.iNet's admin page, save a backup of your settings, and download
   GL.iNet's stock firmware for your model so you can go back.
2. **Upgrade → Local upgrade**: upload the `…-sysupgrade.bin` and **untick
   "Keep settings"**. Alternatively, copy it over SSH and run
   `sysupgrade -n /tmp/<file>`.
3. The router comes back as plain OpenWrt at `192.168.1.1`, with Wi-Fi off.
   Set a root password: SSH in (`ssh root@192.168.1.1`, no password on a fresh
   flash) and run `passwd`, or open the Slate UI at `http://192.168.1.1/` and
   use the Router tab. That password is the Slate UI and SSH login.

If it doesn't boot, GL.iNet's U-Boot has a recovery web page: hold reset
while powering on, set your computer to `192.168.1.2/24`, open
`http://192.168.1.1`, and upload the stock firmware. GL.iNet's "debrick"
guide has the exact LED sequence for your U-Boot version. The
[OpenWrt page for the GL-AR750S](https://openwrt.org/toh/gl.inet/gl-ar750s)
covers both directions.

**Later upgrades, from the Slate itself:** the Slate UI has a **Firmware** tab
that uploads (or fetches by URL) a `…-sysupgrade.bin`, checks it against this
device with `sysupgrade -T`, and flashes only if that check passes — so the box
can update itself without LuCI. It can also write a config backup first. The
U-Boot recovery page above stays the backstop if a flash ever goes wrong.

## Use

**Status page:** `http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/slate-sdr` shows the radios,
card and jobs, with links to the aircraft map, the ISM live view and the
recorded files (`http://192.168.1.1:8081/slate-sdr/`).

**In the Slate UI** (`http://192.168.1.1/`): the *Radios & SDR* tab has the
same status with every address the receivers serve, the aircraft map, the ISM
devices rtl_433 has decoded (one row per device, with its latest readings) and
the recorded files; using a radio hands the RTL-SDR to that job. The Dashboard,
Hosts, Wi-Fi Survey, Threats, Router, Capture, Handshake and Firmware tabs cover
the network, the router and firmware.

**Over SSH:**

```sh
slate-sdr status                          # radios, card, jobs
slate-sdr enable ism                      # (also: disable)
slate-sdr record hackrf 433.92M 2M 30     # 30 s of IQ to the card, SigMF
slate-sdr record rtlsdr 1090M 2.4M 10 --gain 40
slate-sdr spectral                        # one Wi-Fi spectral scan (full build)
slate-sdr log
```

Jobs are set in `/etc/config/slate-sdr` (frequencies, gains, intervals,
rotation, `extra_args` for any receiver option). Run
`/etc/init.d/slate-sdr restart` after editing. Only one job runs per radio:
for example, to use the RTL-SDR for ISM, disable `adsb` and enable `ism`.

**From a computer:**

- **SDR++:** add a SoapySDR source with `driver=remote,remote=tcp://192.168.1.1:55132`,
  or with the `rtltcp` job on, an RTL-TCP source at `192.168.1.1:1234`.
  GQRX takes the same device string. SoapyRemote must be installed on the
  computer.
- The radio must be free: disable the job that holds it, or catch the
  HackRF between `survey` sweeps.
- Over the network, keep the HackRF at 8–10 Msps or below. USB 2.0 and the
  router's CPU limit the rate; samples are sent in their native 8-bit
  format, so the router does no conversion.

**Also in the image:**

- **Ad blocking** for the router's clients (*Services → Adblock*). On a
  router with 128 MB of RAM, start with one list such as OISD small.
- **MQTT broker** (mosquitto, *Services → Mosquitto*) — in the **complete**
  build only (`SLATE_EXTRAS=1`, see *Build*). rtl_433 publishes what it decodes
  to it with `option extra_args '-F mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883,retain=1'` in the
  `ism` job, under `rtl_433/<hostname>/`.
- **tcpdump** (mini) and **horst**, a Wi-Fi analyzer for monitor mode.
- **Network recon** (*Services → Network Recon*):
  - **Dashboard:** one glance at where the Slate is and what it sees — the
    joined network and whether it is online, hosts and access points logged,
    GPS, threats, the radios and the running SDR jobs, each tile linking to
    its tab.
  - **Hosts:** what is on the network this router has joined — passive host
    discovery with arp-scan (IP, MAC, vendor), and a short nmap port scan of
    one host you pick. Discovery is passive; a port scan runs only against the
    host whose button you click.
  - **Wi-Fi Survey:** a wardriving-style log of the access points the Slate
    hears, scanned on a free radio (the USB adapter by default, so the uplink
    and the Pirate Radio AP keep running) and kept with first/last seen,
    strongest signal, channel and security. The image bundles **gpsd** and the
    USB GPS kernel drivers (CDC-ACM and the common serial chips), enabled on
    first boot: plug in a USB GPS and each sighting is tagged with a position,
    with a live GPS status shown on the tab.
  - **Threats:** passive threat detection. A rogue-AP check over the survey
    data flags an SSID advertised both open and secured (an evil twin) and
    your own network names being impersonated; a deauth watch listens on the
    2.4 GHz monitor radio for the management-frame floods a jamming or
    handshake-capture attack sends. Both only listen.

  Saved to the card under `recon/` and `survey/`. Receive/observe only — no
  attack features.

**On the card** (`slate-sdr/<job>/<date>/`):

| Files | Open with |
|---|---|
| `iq-*.sigmf-data/-meta` | inspectrum, Universal Radio Hacker, SigDigger, GNU Radio |
| `sweep-*.csv.gz` | rtl_power/hackrf_sweep CSV: `heatmap.py`, QSpectrumAnalyzer |
| `ism-*.json` | one JSON object per decoded message |
| `aircraft-*.json(.gz)` | concatenated dump1090 `aircraft.json` snapshots (`jq`) |
| `ais-*.nmea` | OpenCPN, gpsd, any AIS decoder |
| `wifi/*/2g-*.bin`, `5g-*.bin` | [FFT_eval](https://github.com/simonwunderlich/FFT_eval) |

## Good to know

- **Clock:** the router has no real-time clock. File times are right once
  it has synced over NTP (it needs internet access through its WAN port).
- **Data rates to the card:** 2 Msps of IQ is 4 MB/s (14 GB an hour). The
  card reader is on USB 2.0; check what your card sustains before
  recording faster. Jobs stop writing below `min_free_mb` (256 MiB).
- **Wi-Fi spectral scan** needs the full build, and a radio that isn't
  serving an access point (OpenWrt ships with Wi-Fi off). Set your country
  with `option country` in the `wifi` job.
- **Monitor mode:** the built-in 2.4 GHz radio (ath9k) does it, and both
  images include the driver for USB Wi-Fi adapters on Ralink's RT2800 chips
  (RT3070, RT5370, RT5372, such as Panda's PAU05 and PAU06). The adapter
  shares the USB port with the radios, so use the powered hub.
- **The law:** what you may receive, decode and record differs by country.

## Tested so far, and what isn't

Tested in this repository's tests and builds:

- All packages cross-compile with the OpenWrt 25.12.6 SDK for this router
  (`mips_24kc`). The binaries run on OpenWrt 25.12.6's MIPS userland under
  QEMU, and SoapySDR loads its HackRF and RTL-SDR modules.
- `tests/rootfs-test.sh` covers every job, the init script, the CLI, the
  status page, the SDR and Network Recon backends (including the Wi-Fi survey
  database, GPS status, threat detection, the dashboard and the nmap scan
  profiles) and the rest of the web UI's backends
  (slate-router, slate-capture, slate-handshake and slate-firmware: their rpcd
  plugins, input validation and JSON shapes, including the set-password, Wi-Fi
  join/scan/status and firmware verify/apply/upload methods — the flasher runs
  against a mock sysupgrade, so no real flash is ever attempted), against mock
  radios and tools on that same userland: 185 checks.
- Both images build on GitHub Actions, and the tests pass there.
- The full build's configuration resolves: `./build-full.sh --config-only`
  keeps `CONFIG_KERNEL_RELAY`, the spectral options and upstream ath10k.

Not yet run:

- On a real GL-AR750S, with real radios. Untested there: the radios'
  throughput over the router's USB, the card reader's write speed, and Wi-Fi
  spectral scan on this hardware. `ath10k` spectral on the QCA9887
  specifically has not been confirmed.
- The web UI's live paths on real hardware: slate-capture's background tcpdump
  and file rotation, slate-handshake's monitor-mode interface and EAPOL
  capture, and slate-recon's scan profiles against a live nmap. The tests cover
  their input validation and JSON; the capture and monitor-mode behaviour
  itself needs the device.
